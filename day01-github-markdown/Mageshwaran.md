I selected this meme because it perfectly represents my experience in class this week. The meme features a picture of a cat looking very confused, with the caption "When the teacher explains something for the 10th time and you still don't get it." I found this meme relatable because I've been struggling with a difficult concept in one of my classes, and no matter how many times the teacher explains it, I just can't seem to understand it. The meme captures the frustration and confusion that I've been feeling, and it made me laugh despite my struggles.
